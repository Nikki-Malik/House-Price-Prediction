# House-Price-Prediction
In this Machine Learning Python project, I walk through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. At the end I present the solution of the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features.
